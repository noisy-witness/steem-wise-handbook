## **First please read the [easiest tutorial on how to start delegating in Wise]({{ "/installation" | relative_url }})**.

Here you will find the suplement information to the above tutorial. 



## Requirements

The shortest way to start is to read the [delegator tutorial]({{ "/installation" | relative_url }}), but if you want do deep dive into becoming a delegator this page is for you.

To start delegating you need to install Wise Cli first, write and upload the rules:

1. [Wise cli installation]({{ "/advanced/cli" | relative_url }})
2. Do `$ wise init` (this is an interactive prompt that will guide you through creating the configuration)
3. [Write the rules]({{ "/rules" | relative_url }}) (There are few examples on the bottom of that page. More complex and real-life examples can be found in the [/samples/rules dir in steem-wise-cli repository](https://github.com/noisy-witness/steem-wise-cli/tree/master/samples/rules))
4. [Upload the rules]({{ "/advanced/synchronising-rules" | relative_url }})
